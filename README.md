# üå± Cura AI ‚Äî AI + Web3 Mental Health Mini App

## 1. Background & Problem
- **Insufficient Supply & Misconceptions**: Mental health issues are often equated with psychiatric disorders in many hospitals, leading to social stigma and preventing people from seeking help.
- **High Cost & Poor Experience**: Traditional counseling is expensive, and therapists often lack consistent encouragement, leaving users without continuous support.
- **Privacy Risks**: Mental health data is extremely sensitive. Existing platforms lack transparency, and users worry about being labeled or having their information leaked.

üëâ As a result, most people with mental health needs are stuck in a state of **‚Äúafraid to ask, can‚Äôt afford, can‚Äôt save.‚Äù**

## 2. Our Solution
**Cura AI = AI Companionship + Web3 Privacy Protection + Gamified Incentives**

- **AI Companionship**
    - 24/7 AI-powered chatbot for emotional support and self-regulation.
    - Clearly positioned as **‚Äúmental health assistant‚Äù**, not a medical diagnostic tool ‚Äî ensuring compliance and safety.
    - *Future plan*: guided breathing, meditation, and emotional journaling tools.

- **NFT Badge System**
    - Users earn **Soulbound NFT badges** by consistent check-ins (daily / cumulative).
    - *Future plan*: journaling, completing exercises.
    - Converts positive behavior into **verifiable digital assets**.
    - Unlike traditional in-app points, NFT badges are **user-owned and portable**, enabling cross-platform display and unlocking future community benefits (e.g., exclusive events, course access).

- **Web3 Privacy Protection**
    - User data is **locally encrypted ‚Üí stored on IPFS ‚Üí hash proof anchored on-chain**.
    - Users have full control over who can access their data (grant/revoke permissions).

## 3. Technical Architecture (How It Works)
- **Identity**: Wallet / DID login, eliminating phone/email sign-ups.
- **AI Layer**: LLM-powered chatbot for companionship, emotion recognition, and risk alerts (non-diagnostic).
- **Privacy Layer**: AES-GCM local encryption + IPFS storage + `keccak256(CID)` on-chain fingerprint.
  > Only encrypted data is stored in decentralized storage. The blockchain only records its fingerprint (hash). **No one, including our team, can view the plaintext.**
- **Incentive Layer**: Soulbound Token (SBT) badges to reward users and engage content creators.

## 4. Why Now (Timing)
- **Rising Demand for Mental Health Support**: Demand has surged post-pandemic, while professional supply remains scarce.
- **AI Companionship Trend**: Users are increasingly comfortable with AI-based mental health assistants and habit-building companions.
- **Web3 Privacy Infrastructure Maturity**: Technologies like IPFS, Account Abstraction, and ZK proofs now make **user-controlled data ownership** feasible.
- **Policy Tailwinds**: Governments are prioritizing mental health, yet existing systems are limited ‚Äî creating space for complementary solutions.
